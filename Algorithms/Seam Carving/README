I made this program for my Algorithms class.
This program takes an image, and finds the seam of least weight.
The seam of least weight is a line running from the top to bottom of an image that has the least weight in terms of some variable, such as color contrast.
This technique can be used to shrink pictures horizontally or vertically without changing important parts.
This program uses the math Python library.
This program only consists of functions and requires a main method that gives it the data in order to run.

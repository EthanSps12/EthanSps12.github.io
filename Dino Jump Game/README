I made this game in my Introduction to Programming course.
Our task was to create a simple clone of the Google dino jump minigame.
This game uses the pygame and random Python libraries, and also requires the gamebox program (not my work).
To try it, download the the dinojump.py and gamebox.py files, then run dinojump.py.
